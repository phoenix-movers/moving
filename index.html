        <!-- What is a Moving Service Section -->
        <section class="section-box">
            <h2>What Is a Moving Service?</h2>
            <p>A moving service is a professional company that assists individuals and businesses in relocating from one place to another. The services can range from packing and transporting your belongings to unloading and even unpacking them at your new location. Moving services cater to various needs, from local moves within the same city to long-distance relocations across the country.</p>
        </section>

        <!-- Types of Moving Services Section -->
        <section class="section-box">
            <h2>Types of Moving Services</h2>
            <p>There are different types of moving services depending on the nature of your move. It’s essential to understand what kind of service you need, so you can hire the right professionals. Here’s a breakdown:</p>
        </section>

        <!-- Residential Moving Section -->
        <section class="section-box">
            <h2>Residential Moving</h2>
            <p>If you’re relocating from one house to another, you’ll need a residential moving service. These companies specialize in helping individuals and families move their personal belongings. Whether you’re moving from a small apartment or a large house, residential moving services can provide tailored assistance.</p>
        </section>

        <!-- Commercial Moving Section -->
        <section class="section-box">
            <h2>Commercial Moving</h2>
            <p>Unlike residential moving, commercial moving involves relocating a business. Whether it’s an office, retail store, or warehouse, this type of move can be more complicated due to the nature of the equipment, furniture, and documents that need to be moved.</p>
        </section>

        <!-- Local Moving Section -->
        <section class="section-box">
            <h2>Local Moving</h2>
            <p>Local moving services typically refer to moves within a short distance, usually within the same city or metropolitan area. If you’re staying within the same area but moving to a new neighborhood, hiring a local moving service is often more affordable and convenient.</p>
        </section>

        <!-- Long-Distance Moving Section -->
        <section class="section-box">
            <h2>Long-Distance Moving</h2>
            <p>For those who are moving across state lines or over 100 miles away, long-distance moving services come into play. These moves require more planning, logistics, and paperwork, especially if you’re moving across borders.</p>
        </section>

        <!-- Specialty Moving Services Section -->
        <section class="section-box">
            <h2>Specialty Moving Services</h2>
            <p>Some moves involve unique items like pianos, antiques, artwork, or large appliances that require specialized equipment and handling. Specialty moving services are designed to meet these specific needs.</p>
        </section>
